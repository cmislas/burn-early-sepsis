The purpose of this study is to refine the methods for predicting sepsis in burn patients using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, to enhance early diagnosis and treatment strategies, focusing on standardized reporting and clinical implementation to improve outcomes for burn patients at risk of developing sepsis.

This model uses RandomForestClassifiers and lists the several features over time. It lists patients that are at risk of sepsis.
